# Gargula

The best things of life are small cute details, so here is Gargula!

A minimalist Terminal interface to help you organize your work

Gargula includes only important data to display, to keep it simple and clean:

- Current directory
- Git Branch (if Git has been intialized)
- Operation number
- A nice arrow that indicates PS1 position

NOTE:
This example is using Dracula dark theme. <br> 
Gargula has nothing to be with the theme(set of colors). <br> 
If you like the theme used just Google Dracula Terminal theme

This is for the mac terminal

The code includes:
